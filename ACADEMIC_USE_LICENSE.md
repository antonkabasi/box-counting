Academic Use License Addendum (AULA) v1.0

This Addendum applies to "Scholarly Works" that use this repository (the
"Software"). A "Scholarly Work" means any scientific or scholarly publication
or submission (e.g., journal article, conference paper, dissertation, preprint)
in which the Software is used to produce results, figures, metrics, or
supporting analyses.

Relationship to BSD-3-Clause
- For all non‑scholarly use, the Software is licensed under the BSD 3‑Clause
  License (see LICENSE). The BSD terms remain in full force.
- For Scholarly Works, you must comply with this Addendum in addition to the
  BSD 3‑Clause terms. If you cannot accept these terms, you must obtain a
  separate written license from the Author before using the Software in a
  Scholarly Work.

Author and Contact

Publication Requirements
1) Prior Notice
   - At least 14 days before submitting a Scholarly Work that uses the
     Software, you must notify the Author via the contact above with a brief
     description of the intended use (what was run, purpose, and venues).

2) Citation
   - You must cite the Software as specified in CITATION.cff (or, if a DOI is
     provided in the repository, cite that DOI) in the Scholarly Work.

3) Authorship (Collaboration Requirement)
   - When the Author provides substantial additional intellectual
     contributions beyond the publicly released Software—such as bespoke
     methods, new features, analysis design, interpretation, or significant
     troubleshooting—the Author must be offered co‑authorship on the Scholarly
     Work, unless the Author explicitly waives co‑authorship in writing.
   - If you intend to rely on the Software for primary results (e.g., core
     figures/metrics), you must contact the Author to discuss collaboration and
     authorship prior to submission.

4) No Silent Use
   - If notice (Section 1) is not provided prior to submission, you are not
     granted permission to use the Software in that Scholarly Work.

No endorsement
- Use of the Author’s name or affiliation for endorsement is prohibited without
  prior written permission.

Disclaimer
- Nothing in this Addendum limits the disclaimers and liability limitations in
  the BSD 3‑Clause License.
